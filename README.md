# Keras Pre-trained Models Loader for Offline Environments

This Python script automates the loading of multiple pre-trained deep learning models from TensorFlow's `keras.applications` module, pre-trained on ImageNet. It is designed to download model weights in advance, enabling offline use in environments with limited or no internet connectivity, such as remote areas in Burkina Faso.

## Purpose

The script loads a wide range of pre-trained models (e.g., Xception, ResNet, EfficientNet, ConvNeXt) into a dictionary, making them accessible for tasks like transfer learning, model comparison, or experimentation. Its primary value lies in enabling offline work by downloading all model weights upfront, which is critical in regions with unreliable network coverage.

### Importance of Offline Support
In areas like Burkina Faso, where internet access can be unstable or unavailable, downloading model weights in advance ensures that machine learning workflows can continue without connectivity. This is particularly useful for:
- **Local servers**: Running inference or training on servers without internet.
- **Embedded devices**: Deploying models on resource-constrained devices in remote locations.
- **Fieldwork**: Supporting applications like medical imaging, agriculture, or education in areas with no network coverage.

By pre-loading weights, the script eliminates dependency on real-time downloads, saving time and ensuring reliability in such environments.

## Models Included

The script supports the following models from `keras.applications`:
- Xception, VGG16, VGG19
- ResNet50, ResNet50V2, ResNet101, ResNet101V2, ResNet152, ResNet152V2
- InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2
- MobileNet, MobileNetV2
- DenseNet121, DenseNet169, DenseNet201
- NASNetMobile, NASNetLarge
- EfficientNetB0 to EfficientNetB7
- EfficientNetV2B0 to EfficientNetV2L
- ConvNeXtTiny, ConvNeXtSmall, ConvNeXtBase, ConvNeXtLarge, ConvNeXtXLarge

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- TensorFlow (`tensorflow>=2.6`)
- Internet connection (initially, to download model weights)
- Sufficient storage and memory for model weights (some models, like ConvNeXtXLarge, require up to 1.3 GB)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the script to download and load all model weights:
   ```bash
   python load_models.py
   ```

2. The script will:
   - Import all listed models from `keras.applications`.
   - Download and load ImageNet weights for each model, storing them locally (typically in `~/.keras/models`).
   - Store models in a dictionary (`models`) with model names as keys.
   - Print success or error messages for each model.

3. Access a specific model offline:
   ```python
   print(models['MobileNet'].summary())  # Example: View MobileNet architecture
   ```

## Code

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.applications import (
    Xception, VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, ResNet50V2, ResNet101, ResNet101V2, 
    ResNet152, ResNet152V2, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, MobileNet, MobileNetV2, 
    DenseNet121, DenseNet169, DenseNet201, NASNetMobile, NASNetLarge, 
    EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB1, EfficientNetB2, EfficientNetB3, EfficientNetB4, 
    EfficientNetB5, EfficientNetB6, EfficientNetB7, EfficientNetV2B0, EfficientNetV2B1, 
    EfficientNetV2B2, EfficientNetV2B3, EfficientNetV2S, EfficientNetV2M, EfficientNetV2L,
    ConvNeXtTiny, ConvNeXtSmall, ConvNeXtBase, ConvNeXtLarge, ConvNeXtXLarge
)

models = {}
model_classes = [
    Xception, VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, ResNet50V2, ResNet101, ResNet101V2, 
    ResNet152, ResNet152V2, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, MobileNet, MobileNetV2, 
    DenseNet121, DenseNet169, DenseNet201, NASNetMobile, NASNetLarge, 
    EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB1, EfficientNetB2, EfficientNetB3, EfficientNetB4, 
    EfficientNetB5, EfficientNetB6, EfficientNetB7, EfficientNetV2B0, EfficientNetV2B1, 
    EfficientNetV2B2, EfficientNetV2B3, EfficientNetV2S, EfficientNetV2M, EfficientNetV2L,
    ConvNeXtTiny, ConvNeXtSmall, ConvNeXtBase, ConvNeXtLarge, ConvNeXtXLarge
]

for model_class in model_classes:
    model_name = model_class.__name__
    try:
        models[model_name] = model_class(weights='imagenet')
        print(f"Successfully loaded {model_name}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error loading {model_name}: {e}")
```

## Why Loading All Models Isn't Always Necessary

While pre-loading all models is valuable for offline environments, it has limitations:
- **Resource Intensive**: Large models (e.g., `NASNetLarge`, `ConvNeXtXLarge`) require significant storage (up to 1.3 GB) and memory, which may overwhelm systems in resource-constrained settings like Burkina Faso.
- **Time-Consuming**: Initial weight downloads can take hours, depending on internet speed, which may be impractical if only a few models are needed.
- **Task-Specific Needs**: Most projects require only one or two models (e.g., MobileNet for low-power devices). Loading all models is overkill if you know your target architecture.
- **Compatibility Risks**: Some models may not work with certain TensorFlow versions or hardware, leading to errors (handled by the script's `try-except`).

### Recommendations
- **Selective Loading**: Modify `model_classes` to include only models relevant to your task (e.g., MobileNet for embedded systems in Burkina Faso).
- **On-Demand Loading**: Create a function to load models only when needed, reducing memory usage.
- **Local Storage**: Once weights are downloaded, they are cached locally, allowing offline use without re-running the full script.

## Use Case: Burkina Faso and Similar Contexts
In regions like Burkina Faso, where network coverage is limited, this script is invaluable for:
- **Agriculture**: Deploying models for crop disease detection on local devices.
- **Healthcare**: Running diagnostic tools (e.g., medical image analysis) in remote clinics.
- **Education**: Supporting offline AI training programs in schools with no internet.

By downloading weights in advance (e.g., in an urban center with connectivity), you can deploy models to rural or disconnected areas, ensuring uninterrupted workflows.

## Troubleshooting

- **Module Not Found**: Ensure TensorFlow is installed (`pip install tensorflow`).
- **Memory Errors**: Reduce the number of models or increase system memory.
- **Weight Download Issues**: Run the script in a location with stable internet to cache weights.
- **Compatibility**: Verify TensorFlow version compatibility (e.g., `tensorflow>=2.6`).
